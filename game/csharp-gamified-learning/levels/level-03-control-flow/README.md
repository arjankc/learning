# Level 3: Control Flow in C#

Welcome to Level 3 of the C# Gamified Learning Project! In this level, you will learn about control flow statements in C#. Control flow statements allow you to dictate the flow of execution in your programs based on certain conditions.

## Objectives
- Understand the concept of control flow.
- Learn how to use `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.
- Implement loops using `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Conditional Statements
- **If Statement**: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- **Else Statement**: Executes a block of code if the condition in the `if` statement is false.
- **Switch Statement**: Selects one of many code blocks to execute based on the value of a variable.

### 2. Loops
- **For Loop**: Repeats a block of code a specified number of times.
- **While Loop**: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- **Do-While Loop**: Similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the block of code will execute at least once.

## Instructions
1. Open the `Program.cs` file in this directory.
2. Follow the comments and instructions in the code to implement control flow statements.
3. Test your code to ensure it behaves as expected.
4. Once you have completed the tasks, you can compare your solution with the provided solution in the `solutions/level-03-control-flow/Solution.cs` file.

## Tips
- Make sure to pay attention to the syntax of each control flow statement.
- Use comments in your code to explain your thought process and logic.
- Experiment with different conditions and loops to see how they affect the flow of your program.

Good luck, and have fun learning about control flow in C#!
