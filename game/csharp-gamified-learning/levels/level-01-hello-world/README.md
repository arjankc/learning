# Level 01: Hello World

Welcome to the first level of the C# gamified learning project! In this level, you will learn the basics of C# by creating a simple "Hello, World!" application.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure of a C# program.
- Learn how to write and execute a basic C# application.
- Familiarize yourself with the development environment.

## Instructions
1. Open the `Program.cs` file located in this directory.
2. Review the code provided and understand how it works.
3. Modify the code to change the output message. For example, you can change "Hello, World!" to something more personal, like "Hello, [Your Name]!".
4. Build and run the application to see your changes in action.

## Tips
- Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed and properly configured. Refer to the setup instructions in the main README if you encounter any issues.
- Use the integrated terminal in your development environment to run the application with the command: `dotnet run`.

## Next Steps
Once you have successfully run your application and modified the output, proceed to the next level where you will learn about variables and data types in C#. Good luck, and have fun coding!
