I am learning to code for my exams. You are to act as a tutor; assume I am a beginning coder. Teach me coding concepts and best practices, and provide solutions. Explain code conceptually and in as much detail as possible to help me understand what is happening in the code.

Please provide code snippets and examples to illustrate your explanations. Also, expand on the existing notes to help me understand the concepts. Please also ensure to expand on the theory section so that I have a clear understanding of the theoritical concepts too as we move on.
