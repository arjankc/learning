# Study Guide: C#/.NET Exam Prep

Use this as your roadmap. Tiers reflect priority: Tier 1 first, then Tier 2, then Tier 3.

## How to study
- Read the theory, then type out the examples yourself.
- After each section, answer the “Check yourself” questions without looking.
- Spaced repetition: revisit weak spots after 1–2 days.
- Practice: small katas; then build a tiny app that touches multiple topics.

## Suggested sequence (2–3 weeks)
1. Tier 1 (Days 1–7): C# Basics, Flow, .NET ecosystem, OOP, Collections, Exceptions/Debugging.
2. Tier 2 (Days 8–13): Delegates/Events, LINQ, Async, ADO.NET/EF Core, File I/O, WPF basics.
3. Tier 3 (Days 14–18): ASP.NET Core, Blazor, Security, Mobile/Xamarin/MAUI, DevOps.

## Check yourself (sample prompts)
- Explain value vs reference semantics; show a bug that arises from misunderstanding them.
- When would you use yield? Show a lazy pipeline over a large file.
- Demonstrate inheritance vs composition; when is each preferable?
- Write a LINQ query for: top 3 items per group; inner join vs group join difference.
- Show async/await with cancellation and explain why async void is dangerous.
- ADO.NET vs EF Core: trade-offs and when to choose each.
- WPF binding modes and validation: set up TwoWay binding with validation.

Good luck—keep it small, steady, and hands-on.
