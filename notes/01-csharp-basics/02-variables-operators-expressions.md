# C# Basics: Variables, Operators, and Expressions

## Variables
Variables are named storage locations in memory that hold data. In C#, you must declare a variable with a specific data type before using it. This helps the compiler allocate the right amount of memory and enforce type safety.

### Key Points:
- Variables must be declared before use.
- The data type determines what kind of data the variable can store.
- Variable names should be descriptive and follow C# naming conventions (camelCase for local variables).

## Operators
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. C# includes several types of operators:
- Arithmetic Operators: For mathematical operations (e.g., +, -, *, /, %)
- Assignment Operators: For assigning values (e.g., =, +=, -=)
- Comparison Operators: For comparing values (e.g., ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Logical Operators: For logical operations (e.g., &&, ||, !)

## Expressions
An expression is a combination of variables, values, and operators that produces a result. For example, a + b is an expression that adds two variables.

## Best Practices
- Use meaningful variable names.
- Keep expressions simple and readable.
- Use parentheses to clarify complex expressions.
