# Classes and Objects

## Concepts
- Class: blueprint of state (fields/properties) and behavior (methods).
- Object: instance of a class with its own state.
- Constructors/Destructors: init/cleanup; destructors are rare in modern .NET.
- Properties/Indexers: encapsulate access; prefer auto-properties with validation as needed.
- Static Members: shared across all instances.
