# Common Language Runtime (CLR)

## Role of CLR
- Executes .NET code (IL -> native) via Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
- Provides memory management (GC), type safety, security, and exceptions.

## Key Services
- Garbage Collection (automatic memory reclamation)
- JIT Compilation and Tiered JIT
- Type System and Metadata
- Assemblies and AppDomains (historical) / AssemblyLoadContext (modern)

## Why It Matters
Performance, safety, interoperability, and deployment behavior all depend on CLR services.
