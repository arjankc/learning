# .NET Framework Architecture

## Theoretical Foundation

### Architectural Philosophy:
The .NET Framework represents a **unified development platform** designed to provide **language interoperability**, **memory safety**, and **platform abstraction**. It embodies the principle of **"write once, run anywhere"** within the Microsoft ecosystem through its **managed execution environment**.

### Design Principles:
1. **Language Neutrality**: Support for multiple programming languages
2. **Type Safety**: Prevention of unsafe memory operations
3. **Automatic Memory Management**: Garbage collection for memory safety
4. **Metadata-Driven Execution**: Self-describing assemblies
5. **Security**: Code access security and verification

## Core Architecture Components:

### Common Type System (CTS):
The CTS defines the **type system** shared across all .NET languages:

#### Theoretical Foundation:
- **Universal Type Model**: Common understanding of types across languages
- **Type Safety**: Prevention of type-related runtime errors
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration between different languages
- **Metadata Integration**: Types carry complete self-description

#### Type Categories:
- **Value Types**: Stack-allocated, passed by value
- **Reference Types**: Heap-allocated, passed by reference
- **Pointer Types**: Unsafe pointers (in unsafe contexts)
- **Generic Types**: Parameterized types for type safety and performance

### Common Language Specification (CLS):
The CLS defines **interoperability rules** for cross-language compatibility:

#### Design Goals:
- **Language Interoperability**: Ensure components work across languages
- **Subset Definition**: Define common denominator of language features
- **Component Contracts**: Establish rules for public interfaces
- **Tool Support**: Enable development tools to work with any CLS-compliant language

#### Compliance Requirements:
- **Public Surface Rules**: Public members must be CLS-compliant
- **Type Usage**: Use only CLS-compliant types in public interfaces
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow consistent naming patterns
- **Feature Restrictions**: Avoid language-specific features in public APIs

## Memory Management Architecture:

### Managed Heap Organization:
The managed heap uses **generational garbage collection**:

#### Generation Theory:
- **Generation 0**: Newly allocated objects (most likely to be collected)
- **Generation 1**: Objects that survived one collection cycle
- **Generation 2**: Long-lived objects (least likely to be collected)
- **Large Object Heap**: Objects larger than 85KB threshold

#### Collection Strategy:
- **Frequency**: Gen 0 collected most frequently
- **Promotion**: Surviving objects promoted to next generation
- **Efficiency**: Most collections only process Gen 0
- **Compaction**: Memory defragmentation during collection

### Garbage Collection Theory:
GC implements **automatic memory management**:

#### Mark and Sweep Algorithm:
1. **Mark Phase**: Identify reachable objects from roots
2. **Sweep Phase**: Deallocate unreachable objects
3. **Compact Phase**: Defragment memory by moving objects
4. **Update References**: Fix pointers after compaction

#### Performance Optimizations:
- **Concurrent Collection**: Background collection in separate thread
- **Server GC**: Optimized for server applications
- **Workstation GC**: Optimized for client applications
- **Low Latency Mode**: Minimizes pause times for real-time applications

## Assembly and Module Architecture:

### Assembly Structure:
Assemblies are **units of deployment** and **security boundaries**:

#### Metadata Integration:
- **Self-Describing**: Contains complete type information
