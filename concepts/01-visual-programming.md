# Visual Programming

## Definition
Visual programming is a programming paradigm that uses graphical elements rather than text to create programs. It allows developers to manipulate program elements graphically rather than textually.

## Visual Programming vs Text-Based Programming

| Aspect | Visual Programming | Text-Based Programming |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Interface** | Drag-and-drop, visual components | Text editor, code writing |
| **Learning Curve** | Easier for beginners | Steeper learning curve |
| **Flexibility** | Limited by available components | Full control over code |
| **Debugging** | Visual debugging tools | Text-based debugging |
| **Performance** | May have overhead | Direct control over performance |
| **Examples** | Visual Studio Designer, Scratch | C#, Java, Python |

## Examples in .NET
- **Visual Studio Designer**: For WPF, WinForms
- **XAML Designer**: For WPF and UWP applications
- **Blazor Visual Designer**: For web components

```csharp
// Text-based approach
Button myButton = new Button();
myButton.Text = "Click Me";
myButton.Width = 100;
myButton.Height = 30;
myButton.Click += MyButton_Click;

// Visual approach (generated code from designer)
// Designer generates similar code but through visual manipulation
```
